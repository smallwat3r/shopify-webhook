# shopify-webhook-receiver

**This project has been archived and is not maintained anymore. Have a look at [shopify-webhook-router]( https://github.com/smallwat3r/shopify-webhook-router) for a more recent implementation.**

This Flask app allows to catch Shopify webhooks and dispatch actions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Set up 
To start the app, first set up a virtual environment, activate it and install the needed dependencies.

```sh
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv --no-site-package
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the needed environment variables.
```sh
$ export HMAC_SECRET=<shared secret signed from Shopify webhook>
$ export FLASK_ENV=<development/production>

$ export FLASK_APP=shopify_listener
```

Launch the app.
```sh
python3 -m flask run --host='0.0.0.0'
```

The activity is logged in a file `logs.log`
```
26-Apr-19 23:01:08 - Webhook topic orders/create has been processed.
26-Apr-19 23:01:08 - 104.197.39.59 - - [26/Apr/2019 23:01:08] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
26-Apr-19 23:01:18 - Webhook topic orders/create has been processed.
26-Apr-19 23:01:18 - 35.239.155.162 - - [26/Apr/2019 23:01:18] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

_**Hint for testing:** It's not possible to link Shopify webhooks from localhost. For testing you can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get a temporary domain._

## üß© Allocate actions to events
You can allocate different actions to do while an event is catched using the private functions in `dispatcher.py`  
You can read each event content using `self.data` from the `Dispatcher` class.   

**Example**  
The webhook topic `orders/create` is called.  
The `dispatch_event()` function will redirect the event to the private function `_orders_create()`.  
In this case, `_orders_create(self)` will retrieve the order id and customer email and do other stuff with this data.  

```python
# dispatcher.py


class Dispatcher:

    def __init__(self, data):
        """Init webhook data."""
        self.data = json.loads(data)

    @staticmethod
    def name_topic(topic):
        """Rename the topic event to match the function names."""
        return "_" + topic.replace('/', '_')

    def dispatch_event(self, topic):
        """Dispatch the event to the correct function."""
        return getattr(self, self.name_topic(topic))()

    # ......
    
    def _orders_create(self):
    	"""Webhook dispatcher for orders/create."""
        order_id, email = self.data['id'], self.data['email']
        # ... now do what you want with order_id and email ...

```
